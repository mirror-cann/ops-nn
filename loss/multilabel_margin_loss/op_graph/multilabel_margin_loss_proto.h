/**
* @brief Computes the multilabel margin loss (multi-class multi-classification hinge loss) between
* input x and target label indices. \n

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: The prediction, a 1D or 2D tensor with shape (C) or (N, C). Support dtype: float32/float16/bfloat16.
* @li target: The label indices, with the SAME shape as x. Each row lists valid class indices in [0, C), the
* remainder filled with the -1 sentinel (read until the first -1). Support dtype: int32. \n

* @par Attributes:
* @li reduction: An optional attribute. Specifies the reduction applied to the output. Type is string.
*                One of "none"/"mean"/"sum". Defaults to "mean" . \n

* @par Outputs:
* @li y: The loss. If reduction is "none" and x is 2D (N, C), y is 1D with shape (N); if reduction is "none"
* and x is 1D, or reduction is "mean"/"sum", y is a scalar. Support dtype: float32/float16/bfloat16.
* @li is_target: A tensor with the SAME shape as target; is_target[.., i] = 1 when i is a label of that
* sample, else 0. Support dtype: int32. \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with pytorch MultiLabelMarginLoss operator
